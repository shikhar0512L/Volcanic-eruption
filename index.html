      <h1>Volcanic eruption</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic
        ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Let's see with a story:</h3>
      <hr>
      <h1>1883 eruption of Krakatoa</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in the Sunda Strait began on 20 May 1883 and peaked on the late morning of
        Monday,
        27 August 1883, when over 70% of the island of Krakatoa and its surrounding archipelago were destroyed as it
        collapsed into a caldera.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The eruption was one of the deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history and explosions
        were so violent that they were heard 3,110 kilometres (1,930 mi) away in Perth, Western Australia, and Rodrigues
        near Mauritius, 4,800 kilometres (3,000 mi) away. The sound was claimed to be heard in 50 different locations
        around the world and the sound wave is recorded to have travelled the globe seven times over. At least 36,417
        deaths are attributed to the eruption and the tsunamis it created.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Significant additional effects were also felt around the world in the days and weeks after the volcano's
        eruption. Additional seismic activity was reported until February 1884, but any reports after October 1883 were
        later dismissed by Rogier Verbeek's investigation into the eruption.</p>

      <h2>Early phase</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In the years before the 1883 eruption, seismic activity around the Krakatoa volcano was intense, with
        earthquakes felt as far away as Australia. Beginning on 19 May 1883, steam venting began to occur regularly from
        Perboewatan, the northernmost of the island's three cones. Eruptions of ash reached an estimated altitude of 6
        km (20,000 ft) and explosions could be heard in New Batavia (Jakarta) 160 km (99 mi) away. </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Eruptions at Krakatoa started again around 16 June, with loud explosions of a thick black cloud covering the
        islands for five days. On 24 June, a prevailing east wind cleared the cloud, and two ash columns could be seen
        issuing from Krakatoa. The seat of the eruption is believed to have been a new vent or vents that formed between
        Perboewatan and Danan. The violence of the ongoing eruptions caused tides in the vicinity to be unusually high,
        and ships at anchor had to be moored with chains. Earthquakes were felt at Anyer, Banten, and ships began to
        report large pumice masses to the west in the Indian Ocean.</p>

        <div class="offcanvas-body">
          <p>Volcanoes erupt when molten rock called magma rises to the surface. Magma is formed when the earth's mantle
            melts.

            Melting may happen where tectonic plates are pulling apart or where one plate is pushed down under another.

            Magma is lighter than rock so rises towards the Earth's surface. As the magma rises, bubbles of gas form
            inside it.

            Runny magma erupts through openings or vents in the earth's crust before flowing onto its surface as lava.

            If magma is thick, gas bubbles cannot easily escape and pressure builds up as the magma rises.

            When the pressure is too much an explosive eruption can happen, which can be dangerous and destructive.

            Another way an eruption happens is when water underneath the surface interacts with hot magma and creates
            steam,

            this can build up enough pressure to cause an explosion.</p>
